You will learn how to proceed from identifying the problem to planning and carrying out an investigation in such a way that the results will enable you to conclude that the factor you are investigating does (or does not) cause the event to happen. Along the way, you will see how some of the greatest biologists have used this scientific method in their investigations.

        "chunk_text": "Biology is the science of life and living organisms. You know from earlier studies that an organism is a living being made from one cell (for example bacteria, unicellular algae) or many cells (for example, animals, plants and most fungi).\nWhen we think of biologists, we often have quite a narrow view of what they do. But, just as all chemists don\u2019t wear white coats, all biologists don\u2019t look down microscopes in laboratories. Here are just a few of the areas of biological study.\nSome biologists become astrobiologists. These biologists engage in all kinds of research to try to find evidence of life on other planets in our Solar System and in galaxies elsewhere in the Universe.\nOther biologists take part in biomedical research. These biologists help in many areas, including the development of new drugs and vaccines. They also study the ways in which diseases develop to gain a better understanding of them so that cures can be found.\nOthers still become microbiologists. These biologists study how micro-organisms of all kinds function. Some micro-organisms cause disease, and understanding how they work makes a treatment more likely. Many microbiologists are studying the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) to get a better understanding of how AIDS develops and how it can be treated.\nPaleobiology is a fascinating area of study to many people. Paleobiologists try to find out more about the way in which life began on Earth and how it has evolved from simple life forms into more complex ones. They use evidence from fossils and from studies of the chemistry of ancient rocks to make estimates of when and how new life forms appeared on the planet.\nMany different biologists are involved in the Human Genome Project. This enormous project has produced the first ever map of the 46 chromosomes found in human cells. It has located the tens of thousands of genes and has determined the exact structure of each chromosome. Although the \u2018map\u2019 is finished, there is still much to be found out. Analysis will continue for many years to come.\nBesides these biologists, there are others who are, perhaps, more recognisable. These include: doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, nurses, physiotherapists, botanists, zoologists, physiologists, biochemists, agricultural biologists, ecologists, ethologists, entomologists, geneticists, oncologists, neurobiologists, parasitologists . . . . . . and many, many others besides.",

        "chunk_text": "The word science comes from the Latin word scientia, which means \u2018knowledge\u2019. But science isn\u2019t just about having knowledge: science is a unique system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method. This science is sometimes called experimental science, because it depends very heavily on experimentation to obtain the information. This is different from applied science, in which scientific research is used to meet certain human needs. However, it is often difficult to separate the two.\nScience is an ongoing effort to find new information and principles which can increase human knowledge and understanding. In their research, scientists collect evidence that supports or disproves a particular suggested explanation of a natural phenomenon. One important idea in science is that any suggested explanation of a phenomenon should be capable of being proved wrong. If there is no way of proving it wrong, how can other people accept that it is correct? This is what distinguishes science from religious beliefs.",

        "chunk_text": "This is the process by which biologists and all other scientists approach their work. For centuries, people based their explanations of what they saw going on in the world around them on observations, without testing their ideas to see if they were true. One ancient belief was that simple living organisms could come into being by spontaneous generation. This idea suggests that non-living objects can give rise to living organisms.\nAs an example:\n\u2022 Observation: Every year in the spring, the river Nile flooded areas of Egypt leaving behind mud containing many nutrients that enabled the people to grow that year\u2019s crop. However, along with the muddy soil, large numbers of frogs appeared that weren\u2019t around in drier times.\n\u2022 Conclusion: Muddy soil gives rise to frogs!\nAlso, before the invention of the refrigerator, animal carcasses were hung by the heels in butcher\u2019s shops and people would ask the butcher to cut off the part they wanted. The shop was always full of flies. So people believed that the meat had turned into flies!\nBecause of these and other observations, many people, including quite eminent \u2018scientists\u2019 of the day, produced recipes for \u2018creating\u2019 life from non-living objects. It took the work of Louis Pasteur using the proper scientific method to finally disprove this myth.",

        "chunk_text": "The scientific method consists of a number of stages. These are summarised in the flowchart. So what is happening at each of these stages? What is the biologist doing and what do we mean by hypothesis?\nTo help you understand what is happening at each stage of the scientific method, an example using the growth of a tomato seed is detailed below.\nStep of the method What happens at this step\nAsk a question Something catches our imagination. We know that tomato seeds germinate when they are planted. But, why don\u2019t tomato seeds grow inside tomatoes?\nDo background research Before we start trying to do the whole investigation ourselves, we will first check scientific magazines and the internet to see if anyone else has looked into the problem, or into a similar problem. We find out that there are substances in plants that control growth, called growth regulators.\nConstruct hypothesis \u2018There are chemicals in tomatoes that stop the seeds from growing whilst they are still in the tomatoes themselves.\u2019 This hypothesis is testable by an experiment. We think that it is a chemical that is responsible. So how do we prove that? We could try covering some seeds with tomato juice and others with water and see if any germinate. Based on our hypothesis, we can make a prediction: \u2018Seeds covered in tomato juice will not germinate as well as seeds covered in water\u2019.\nDesign and carry out an experiment to test the hypothesis 1. Put several tomatoes in a blender. 2. Filter (strain) the blended material through some muslin. 3. Collect the tomato seeds and wash them in distilled water. 4. Place 20 in a Petri dish on filter paper and cover them with the tomato juice obtained from filtering the tomatoes. 5. Place 20 in a Petri dish on filter paper and cover them with the same volume of distilled water. 6. Place them in a growth cabinet that will keep the temperature and lighting conditions constant. 7. Leave them for four days. 8. Check the number that have germinated in each condition. 9. Repeat the experiment 50 times to confirm your results.\nAnalyse results and draw conclusions Out of 1000 seeds sown in each condition, 668 germinated in the distilled water (13.36 per dish) and 265 germinated in the tomato juice (5.3 per dish). It seems like something in the tomato juice is affecting the germination of the seeds. It can\u2019t be the cells themselves, because they were filtered off. It must be a chemical in the juice.\nAccept or reject the hypothesis It seems as though the hypothesis is along the right lines; the tomato juice will only contain chemicals, not cells, and it does reduce the amount of germination. So we accept the hypothesis. But inside the tomatoes themselves, none of the seeds germinate. There is a bit more work to do yet!\nReport results We must now decide whether or not to report the results to other biologists. Someone else might decide to take the work further and try to isolate a particular chemical from the many in the juice to find exactly what is stopping them from growing inside the tomato itself.",

        "topic": "How did the scientific method disprove the idea of spontaneous generation?",
        "chunk_text": "What about the belief that rotting meat produces flies? How could you disprove that by using the scientific method? Well, in 1668 an Italian biologist, Francesco Redi, did just that. Many scientists consider this to be the first true \u2018experiment\u2019. He used wide-mouth jars containing meat. Some jars were left open to the air. Others were covered with a piece of gauze. After several days, maggots and then flies could be seen in the open jars, but none appeared in the closed jars.\nRedi hypothesised that only flies could produce more flies and predicted that, in his experiment, flies would be found in the open jars, but not in the covered jars. He maintained all the jars under the same conditions and so he controlled many variables. By choosing to cover some jars with gauze rather than an impermeable seal, he allowed air to enter all the jars \u2013 again he controlled a variable that could have affected the outcome of the experiment. His results matched his prediction and when other people tried the experiment, they too got the same results. Redi was able to conclude that flies cannot be produced from rotting meat. He also went on to say that it was unlikely that any form of spontaneous generation was possible.\nMost people accepted this for larger organisms, but, at round about this time, the microscope had been invented and the whole world of microbiology was opened up. Many people still believed that micro-organisms could arise by spontaneous generation. It took the work of Louis Pasteur to disprove this. In 1859, Pasteur carried out experiments to show that the micro-organisms that caused wine and broth to go cloudy came from the air and were not made from the broth itself. He used special \u2018swan-necked flasks\u2019 like that shown in Figure 1.4.\nPasteur boiled broths in swan-necked flasks to kill any micro-organisms that might be in them. The boiling forced steam and air out of the flasks. When the boiling stopped and the broth cooled, air was sucked back into the flasks. Some contained a filter to prevent all solid particles from getting into the growth medium from the air. Others had no filter but, in these, the dust (and the micro-organisms) in the air settled in the lowest part of the neck of the flask. All the flasks were kept under the same conditions in Pasteur\u2019s laboratory.\nPasteur found that the broths stayed clear for months. At the end of this time, he treated the flasks in one of three ways: \u2022 He left some of them as they were. \u2022 He broke the necks on some. \u2022 He tilted others to allow the dust in the low part of the neck to mix with the broths.\nThe broths in the second two groups of flasks turned cloudy (due to the presence of micro-organisms) within days. The broths in the first group remained clear. After this, people were forced to admit that spontaneous generation, even of micro-organisms, could not happen.\nOne stage in the scientific method is to \u2018do background research\u2019. Pasteur certainly did that. He knew that other scientists had tried to disprove spontaneous generation before him and he was able to draw on the results of their experiments and improve their technique.",

        "chunk_text": "Scientific experiments try to establish cause and effect. This means that they try to prove that a change in one factor brings about a change in another factor. The factor that the scientist changes, or manipulates, is called the independent variable (or IV for short). The factor that the scientist measures to see if it changes when the IV is changed is called the dependent variable (or DV for short). The scientist will want to find out if changes in the independent variable produce changes in the dependent variable. In the example on pages 5 and 6, the independent variable was the presence or absence of tomato juice. The dependent variable was the number of tomato seeds germinating.\nTo prove cause and effect \u2013 to prove that it is changes in the IV (and nothing else) that are causing changes in the DV \u2013 we must take all the steps we can to ensure that the experiment is a fair test. We must make sure that any other factors which could affect the results are the same for the different conditions we set up.\nIn the tomato seed example, if one group of seeds had been at a higher temperature than the other group, this could have made them germinate faster. We wouldn\u2019t have known whether it was the tomato juice affecting the results or the temperature. Our experiment would not be valid. So we must keep constant anything other than the IV that might influence the results. These are controlled variables. In the tomato seed experiment, the controlled variables were: \u2022 temperature \u2022 lighting conditions \u2022 number of seeds per dish, and \u2022 volume of liquid added (water or tomato juice).\nOccasionally, there is a variable that might influence the results that you can\u2019t control. Such a variable is a confounding variable. This is because it \u2018confounds\u2019 the interpretation of the results. You couldn\u2019t be certain that it was the IV producing the changes in the DV because of the presence of the confounding variable. For example, if you measure the carbon dioxide uptake by wheat plants as the light intensity changes over the day, you cannot control the effect of change in temperature.

For example, if you were timing a reaction that was likely to last a few minutes at most, the stop-clock would be the best choice. But if you were timing something that lasts several hours, you just don\u2019t need that level of precision and it might even be a hindrance \u2013 by measuring the seconds accurately, you might lose track of the hours!\nTo measure volume, you could use: \u2022 a syringe \u2022 a measuring cylinder \u2022 a pipette \u2022 a burette\nAll of these come in various sizes.

It is important,\nthen, that the layout of the report is recognisable to everyone and\nunderstandable by everyone. So, there is a set way to lay out such a\nreport. It is not always identical in every case, but there are certain\n\u2018rules\u2019 to follow.\nThere must be:\n\u2022 a title, which states clearly what is being investigated\n\u2022 a hypothesis, stated clearly in terms of how the independent\nvariable is expected to influence the dependent variable, often\nextended to a prediction for the particular experiment\n\u2022 a clear description of the experimental procedure; this must be in\nsuch detail that anyone of the same level of understanding could\neasily replicate the procedure and it must include:\n\u2013 the apparatus used (a diagram of the assembled apparatus is\nuseful)\n\u2013 details of any chemicals used; what volumes or concentrations\nor masses were used\n\u2013 details of any organisms used (for example, yeast, mice) \u2013 what\nstrain and how many\n\u2013 details of any control experiments\n\u2022 a full account of the results obtained; it is often helpful to\nsummarise these (where appropriate) in graphs, charts and tables\n\u2022 the conclusions that have been drawn from the results\n\u2022 an evaluation of the procedure; this is an honest assessment of\nthe limitations of the procedure that has been used, pointing out\nany unavoidable limitations and inaccuracies that arose\n\u2022 an acknowledgement of the use of any other person\u2019s work; this\nis usually done by identifying by a number the place in the report\nwhere other work has been used, and then listing the sources at\nthe end of the work\nSo, for the tomato seed experiment, the report could look\nsomething like this:\nSection How it would be written\nTitle An investigation into the effect of tomato juice on the germination of tomato\nseeds.\nHypothesis A chemical in tomato juice inhibits the germination of seeds.\nPrediction Seeds covered in tomato juice will germinate less well than seeds covered in\ndistilled water.\nProcedure 30 tomatoes were blended for five minutes.\nThe blended material was then filtered through some muslin and the liquid\n(juice) was collected. The seeds were extracted from the cellular material,\nwhich was then discarded.\nThe juice was diluted with distilled water to give a total volume of 550 cm3.\nThe tomato seeds were washed in distilled water for 30 seconds, to remove any\nchemicals from their surface. They were dried briefly on filter paper.\n100 Petri dishes were prepared by placing a piece of filter paper in each. Each\npiece of filter paper had a 0.5 cm grid drawn on it.\n20 seeds were placed in each Petri dish on the intersections of the lines of the\ngrid (to ensure even spacing in all dishes).\n10 cm3 tomato juice was added to half of the Petri dishes and 10 cm3 distilled\nwater was added to the other half.\nAll the dishes were placed in an incubator at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C for four\ndays.\nAt the end of this time the number of successful germinations in each dish was\nrecorded and means for each condition were calculated. If a radicle (root) of\n0.5 cm or more was present, the seed was said to have germinated.\nResults Out of 1000 seeds sown in each condition, 668 germinated in the distilled\nwater (13.36 per dish) and 265 germinated in the tomato juice (5.3 per dish).\nConclusion The hypothesis is accepted. The germination of the seeds in the tomato juice\nis much less successful than in distilled water. Some chemical in the tomato\njuice must therefore be inhibiting the germination. In tomato fruits, no seeds\ngerminate, but it must be remembered that in our investigation, the juice had\nbeen diluted to give sufficient volume for 50 replicates of the investigation.\nEvaluation There were no anomalous results. The germination of seeds in all of the dishes\nin the experimental condition (the tomato juice) was less successful than in\nthe dishes in the control condition (distilled water).\nThe experiment was not without limitations.\n\u2022 It was only carried out for four days (to limit the development of fungal\ngrowth that might have interfered with germination). Had it been carried out\nfor longer, the pattern may have been different.\n\u2022 It was only carried out at one temperature; this may have influenced the\nexperimental and control conditions differently. Repeating the investigation\nat a range of temperatures would help to clarify this.\n\u2022 The judgement of germination (a radicle of 0.5 cm length) was somewhat\narbitrary, but it did overcome the problem of including in the count seeds\nthat had merely swollen with water but not produced any growth.\nWe are of the opinion that these limitations had only a minor effect on the\nvalidity and reliability of this experiment.\nAcknowledgements Biology \u2013 Martin Rowlands \u2013 information on plant growth regulators.\nThe above report has been tabulated for your ease of understanding.

All these are used for measuring volumes, usually of\nliquids, but in some investigations they can be used to measure the\nvolume of a gas. In this example, an upturned measuring cylinder\nis being used to collect oxygen gas produced when yeast converts\nhydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.\nSome syringes are designed specifically as \u2018gas syringes\u2019 and could\nbe used as an alternative way of collecting the oxygen in the above\nexperiment.\nBalances are used for measuring mass. They come in a range of\nsizes and properties. Some can measure the mass of very heavy\nobjects, but not with any great degree of precision.\nOthers measure smaller masses to the nearest 0.0001 g\n(one ten-thousandth of a gram).\nSometimes biologists need to dissect specimens\nto find out what they are like inside. This need not\nalways mean dissecting a whole organism. Quite\noften, students dissect organs, such as the heart or the\nkidney, to find out about their structure. Biologists\nmay dissect owl pellets \u2013 these are pellets containing\nthe parts of food that the owl has eaten and that\ncannot be digested and have been regurgitated.\nDissecting these can give information about what the\nbird has been eating.\nFigure 1.11 shows a standard dissecting kit containing a magnifying\nglass, scalpels, scissors, forceps (tweezers) and mounted needles.\nFigure 1.12 shows a student dissecting a frog. The student is using a\nscalpel to cut away the skin and reveal the abdominal organs. These\ncan then be removed and studied individually.\nPetri dishes are round dishes made from glass or from plastic.\nThey are used in many different ways, but usually to culture some\norganisms.\nThey are often filled with a \u2018jelly\u2019 called agar and used to culture\nbacteria. There are many different agars containing different\nbalances of nutrients. Each type of agar can encourage the growth\nof different bacteria. By marking a grid on the surface of the Petri\ndish, biologists can estimate how much of the dish is covered by\nbacteria and then use this to estimate how fast the bacteria are\ngrowing.\nPetri dishes are also used to propagate or culture plants. The\nsmall \u2018plantlets\u2019 or \u2018explants\u2019 in figure 1.14 have been grown on a\nspecial agar from just a few plant cells. They will grow roots and\nthen shoots and leaves. When they are big enough, they will be\ntransplanted into pots of soil or compost and grown into mature\nplants.\nPetri dishes can also be used to:\n\u2022 show how effective different antibiotics are against certain types\nof bacteria\n\u2022 show how well different concentrations of enzymes digest a\nsubstance\nAs you know already from your study in grade 9, microscopes\nare one of the most vital tools in a biology laboratory. There\nare two main types:\n\u2022 optical microscopes that use beams of light to produce\nmagnified images\n\u2022 electron microscopes that use beams of electrons to produce\nmagnified images\nYou are unlikely ever to use an electron microscope, simply because\nof cost. Light microscopes vary from basic microscopes that can be\nused in the laboratory and even taken out and used in the field to\nvery sophisticated microscopes that are linked to image-enhancing\ncomputer programs to produce all kinds of images that help to\nmake the image clearer. Of course, biologists also use electron microscopes that give much\nhigher magnifications and, importantly, much higher resolution, so\nthat more detail can be seen.\nTransmission electron microscopes allow researchers to view\nthe structure of cells in great detail. The transmission electron\nmicrograph (TEM) of the cell from the leaf of a tobacco plant in\nfigure 1.18B shows six large chloroplasts, the vacuole of the cell and\nthe nucleus and cytoplasm. Scanning electron microscopes do not\nsee \u2018into\u2019 cells in the same way, but create images of the surface of\na specimen by scanning it with a high-energy beam of electrons.\nComputer programming allows the different parts to be \u2018false\ncoloured\u2019 for clearer interpretation. This is shown in the scanning\nelectron micrograph (SEM) of the head of a monarch butterfly,\nfigure 1.18A.\nCentrifuges are used to separate solids from liquids where simple\nfiltration is not adequate for the task. Some solid particles are very\ntiny and float around in a liquid, although they are not properly\ndissolved in the liquid.\nCentrifugation can separate these solid particles from the liquid\nwithout the need to filter. The mixture is placed in a \u2018centrifuge tube\u2019\nand placed in the centrifuge. The centrifuge then spins the tubes at\nhigh speed. As the tubes spin, the gravitational forces on the solid\nparticles force them to the bottom of the tube. Some centrifuges,\ncalled \u2018ultracentrifuges\u2019, can spin really fast and cause extremely light\nparticles to fall to the bottom of the tube. These ultracentrifuges are\nused to separate the various components of animal and plant cells.\nCentrifugation is commonly used in hospitals for stool tests where\nthe ability to separate particles quickly and clearly is very useful.",

        "chunk_text": "At the start of this unit we defined biology as \u2018the science of life\u2019. This makes it a pretty big subject! Biology seeks to understand how all life functions \u2013 including life on other planets, should it exist. Biology attempts to give scientific answers to many questions that most people think are important. Some of these are listed below: \u2022 Where did humans come from? \u2022 Where did I come from? \u2022 How do I work? \u2022 How did all life begin? \u2022 How is disease caused? \u2022 How is AIDS caused? \u2022 How can vaccines be developed against diseases like malaria and AIDS? \u2022 What makes cancer cells different from ordinary cells? \u2022 Will it ever be possible to grow a new kidney just for me? \u2022 Will people one day live forever? \u2022 What causes global warming? \u2022 How can we solve problems of food shortage? Because biology is the science of life, biologists undertake all kinds of research. Some try to find possible biological explanations for other, non-scientific, aspects of life. Some try to find biological explanations for why some people: \u2022 have a strong religious belief whilst others don\u2019t \u2022 are record-breaking athletes, like Haile Gebrselassie and Meseret Defar, and others aren\u2019t \u2022 have amazing musical talent, whilst others don\u2019t, or \u2022 can write poetry, whilst others can\u2019t. Biologists also try to find out why organisms behave in the way that they do. When this is applied to humans, it is often called \u2018behavioural psychology\u2019, but many consider it to be a branch of biology. Some of these biologists believe that it will one day be possible to understand how all the nerve cells that make up the brain interact with each other to store memories, carry out problem-solving activities and learn as well as modify behaviour patterns. The study of biology has relevance in almost every aspect of life. It would take far too long to analyse all aspects of the relevance of biology. However, there are some which are undoubtedly of great importance. Biology and agriculture The world\u2019s population is growing at an alarming rate and this poses challenges to governments all over the world. The extra people all need homes, food and all the other services that are provided. Many biologists are addressing the problem of how to produce the extra food. However, they have another problem to consider, which is that global warming may alter the way in which crops grow. Many crops that now produce high yields in some countries will not do so if the current trends continue. Some countries will benefit, as they will find that their agricultural output will increase with global warming. There are many different estimates as to which countries will \u2018win\u2019 and which will \u2018lose\u2019. So how can biologists help? They are carrying out research into how to produce crop plants that: \u2022 will be adapted to the new conditions \u2022 are capable of producing their crop quickly so that more than one crop can be obtained per year from a field \u2022 are disease resistant \u2022 are drought resistant This work involves the genetic modification of existing crop plants to give them the new characteristics that will enable them to be productive in the changed environment.",

        "topic": "Why is water so important to living things?",
        "chunk_text": "The very first cells on Earth evolved in water about 3.5 billion years\nago. Water has many properties that make it important to living\nthings in a number of ways, such as:\n\u2022 a place to live\n\u2022 a transport medium\n\u2022 a reactant in many chemical reactions\n\u2022 a place for other reactions to take place\n\u2022 water is a vital chemical constituent of living cells\nWater is a place to live in. Many organisms live in water. Plants and\nalgae both live in water as do many different types of animals\nWater is transparent. This means that light can pass through the\nwater and allow the plants and algae to photosynthesise. It also\nmeans that animals can see where they are going. However, water\ndoes not allow all light to pass through it and as we go deeper and\ndeeper, less and less light penetrates.\nDifferent wavelengths of light penetrate to different depths. Red\nand indigo wavelengths are soon lost. Blue and green wavelengths\npenetrate deeper than others.\nWater has a high specific heat capacity. This means that it takes\nquite a lot of energy to heat water up. Water also loses heat quite\nslowly. This has the overall effect that water stays more or less the\nsame temperature \u2013 particularly large masses of water, such as\noceans and lakes. This is important as the functioning of enzymes\nin living cells is affected by temperature. Too hot or too cold and the\nenzymes do not function efficiently and the reactions in the cells\ncontrolled by the enzymes are not carried out efficiently.\nIce is less dense than liquid water. It is unusual for the solid form\nof a substance to float on the liquid form of the same substance, but\nice floats on water. This is because water expands when it freezes.\nSo, in cold weather, water freezes from the top down. The ice on the\nsurface then acts as an insulator and slows down the heat loss from\nthe liquid water underneath. So life can continue in relatively warm\nwater underneath the ice all through the cold weather.\nWater has a high latent heat of vaporisation. This means that\nit takes a lot of energy to turn liquid water into water vapour (or\nsteam). In turn this means that water doesn\u2019t vaporise too easily\nand that ponds don\u2019t dry up too quickly in hot weather \u2013 and\nthe organisms in the pond have a better chance of survival. This\nproperty is also important in temperature control.\nWhen we sweat, the energy needed to vaporise the sweat comes\nfrom our bodies. This heat is then lost from our bodies and so\nwe cool down. If water vaporised easily, sweating wouldn\u2019t be as\neffective in controlling our body temperature.\nWater has a high surface tension. The water molecules in the\nmain body of a mass of water are hydrogen-bonded to other water\nmolecules on all sides. But at the surface, there is no hydrogen\nbonding above. So the \u2018pull\u2019 from the sides is stronger than it would\notherwise be and the molecules at the surface are held together\nmore strongly.\nThis is why some animals can \u2018walk on water\u2019 and why others can\nattach themselves to the surface of the water and live just below\nthe surface. The water strider in figure 2.10 is just one example of\nan insect that is so light that the force of the surface tension of the\nwater can support the weight of the insect.\nThe mosquito larvae in figure 2.11 hang from the surface of the\nwater by their breathing tubes. The surface tension is sufficiently\nstrong to hold their weight.\nWater is a good solvent for many substances Many organic and\ninorganic substances important to life dissolve in water, but don\u2019t\ndissolve either at all or as well in other liquids. Water is very\nversatile. Because these substances dissolve in water, they can\nbe transported in a water-based transport medium. Biological\nmechanisms such as active transport, diffusion and facilitated\ndiffusion move the substances into and out of the water (in the\ntransport medium). In mammals, the plasma of blood is 90% water.\nThis is forced through the system of veins arteries and capillaries by\nthe heart. In plants water carries dissolved minerals upwards from\nthe roots to other parts of the plants in the xylem vessels. Water in\nthe phloem tubes carries dissolved organic substances all over the\nplant.\nWater has the ideal viscosity for a transport medium. Viscosity is a\nmeasure of how fluid a liquid is \u2013 how easily it flows. If water were\nmore viscous (less fluid) than it is \u2013 think of tar! \u2013 then the heart\nwould not be able to move it through the blood vessels. Also, the\nwater inside cells transports substances around the cell; if it were\nmore viscous, it would damage the delicate organelles in the cells.\nIf water were less viscous (more fluid) than it is, it would flow too\neasily and, inside cells, the organelles would not be supported.\nSimilarly, in the circulatory system, a less viscous liquid would not\nmove the blood cells around the system as efficiently.",

For example, lipase (lipid hydrolysing enzyme), sucrase (sucrose hydrolysing enzyme). \u2022 Sometimes the enzymes are named on the basis of the reaction that they catalyse. For example, polymerase (aids in polymerisation \u2013 joining similar units together), dehydrogenase (removal of hydrogen atoms or ions). \u2022 Some enzymes have been named based on the source from which they were first identified. For example, papayin from papaya. Others are named according to where they act. For example, intestinal protease acts on proteins in the intestine. \u2022 The names of some enzymes end with \u2018in\u2019, indicating that they are basically proteins. For example, pepsin, trypsin, etc. These enzymes usually have alternative names that tell you rather more about them. For example, the alternative name for pepsin is gastric protease. This tells you that it acts on proteins and it does so in the stomach. Because of the varied ways in which enzymes had been named, biologists at the Enzyme Commission decided to produce a systematic way of naming enzymes, based on the ways in which the enzymes act. To appreciate this, we must first look at how enzymes are classified.",

Yeast is a unicellular fungus that ferments carbohydrates to produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. The enzymes in yeast control the reactions of fermentation. We still use yeast to brew alcoholic drinks, such as tella, and to bake breads, such as injera. Both these Ethiopian products are often made at home, as well as professionally. When dough is baked to produce the bread, the tiny amount of alcohol formed is lost and the carbon dioxide expands to make the dough \u2018rise\u2019 to form a loaf of bread. When beer is brewed, it is the carbon dioxide that is lost and the alcohol remains! However, enzyme technology is now very big business. Enzymes are used in many industries. They are used to produce washing powders \u2013 the enzymes in the washing powders digest the stains in the clothes. \u2018Stone-washed\u2019 denim jeans are now given their stone- washed look by the action of enzymes. Table 3.3 shows just a few of the areas where enzyme technology is used. One of the appeals of using enzymes in industry is that they allow the reactions involved in the processes to be carried out at much lower temperatures. This means less energy (and therefore less money) is spent on heating the reactants. Because less heating is required, less carbon dioxide is produced and this can benefit the environment as carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and its accumulation in the atmosphere can lead to global warming.",

One egg cannot sit inside another egg because the shapes are the same. The complementary substrate molecule binds with the active site of the enzyme to form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex. The complex causes the reactants to enter a transition state in which the activation energy of the reaction is lowered. The reaction takes place and the products formed are released. The lock-and-key model of enzyme action suggests that the enzyme lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative pathway for the reaction. For example: Non-catalysed pathway: Reactant A + Reactant B \u279e Product AB Enzyme-catalysed pathway: Reactant A + Reactant B + enzyme \u279e Intermediate \u279e Product AB + enzyme This model sees the enzyme\u2013substrate complex as the intermediate, which is part of a pathway that requires less energy than the normal pathway.

In the transition state, bonds in the reactants are put under strain and break more easily and rejoin with other bonds to form the products. The products formed leave the active site. Most biologists now prefer the induced-fit model over the lock- and-key model as it explains other properties of enzymes, such as enzyme inhibition, in a more complete manner than the lock-and- key model. The rate of a chemical reaction is the rate at which reactants are converted into products. In the case of an enzyme-controlled reaction, this is determined by how many molecules of substrate bind with enzyme molecules to form enzyme\u2013substrate complexes.

This increases the probability that a substrate particle will collide with an enzyme molecule. \u2022 Particles within a molecule vibrate more energetically. This puts strain on the bonds that hold the atoms in place. Bonds begin to break and, in the case of an enzyme, the shape of the molecule, and the active site in particular, begin to change. The enzyme begins to lose its tertiary structure (remember it is a protein) and denature. The activity of an enzyme at a given temperature is a balance between these two effects. If the raised temperature results in little denaturation but a greatly increased number of collisions, the activity of the enzyme will increase. If the higher temperature causes significant denaturation then, despite the extra collisions, the activity of the enzyme will probably decrease. The temperature at which the two effects just balance each other is the optimum temperature for that enzyme. Any further increase in temperature will cause increased denaturation that will outweigh the effects of extra collisions. A decrease in temperature means that fewer collisions will occur. Note that the graph is not symmetrical.

Look at figure 4.13. It shows three cubic \u2018cells\u2019 of different sizes. The linear dimensions double from the first cell to the second and double again from the second cell to the third.

It is best understood if we think of just one function \u2013 that of respiration. A cell respires to release energy to drive all the other cellular processes that take place. If it can\u2019t release enough energy, these other processes will slow down and the cell may die. In order to respire, the cell needs oxygen, which enters through the surface of the cell.\n\u2022 The volume determines how much activity there is in a cell. A large cell will have more processes happening, or at least the same processes happening faster, than a smaller cell. The amount of energy that must be released in respiration is therefore decided largely by the volume.\n\u2022 The amount of oxygen that can be delivered into the cell is decided largely by how much \u2018surface\u2019 there is, since it is through the surface of the cell that the oxygen enters.\nA large surface-area-to-volume ratio means that it is likely that the surface will be able to supply the oxygen demands of the cell. But as cells increase in size, the volume increases faster than the surface area and the surface-area-to-volume ratio decreases.

Prokaryotic cells are much smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells; even so these cells must carry out all the same functions that a eukaryotic cell carries out in order to survive. There is therefore some division of labour within the cell. There are specialised regions for certain functions. You can see this in figure 4.14.\nHowever, there is much more division of labour in a eukaryotic cell. There are different types of eukaryotic cell, but all of them have a number of features in common. Figure 4.15 shows a generalised animal cell. Most of the structures shown are found in all eukaryotic cells. Plant cells have a number of other structures in addition to these, as figure 4.16 shows.\nThese are clearly much more complex cells than the prokaryotic cell. What is really different about them is that there are many more different individual structures, called organelles, in the cell. Also, there are many more membranes in the cell. Some of these form the complex membrane system that is found throughout the cell \u2013 the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to these, several of the organelles are surrounded by membranes. These are the:\n\u2022 nucleus\n\u2022 mitochondria\n\u2022 chloroplasts (if present)\n\u2022 lysosomes\n\u2022 Golgi apparatus\nThese are called membrane-bound organelles.\nThese membranes make the cell able to function more efficiently. Because each mitochondrion is enclosed by a membrane (actually by two membranes!), the reactions that take place here are not affected by other cellular reactions. The same applies to the other membrane-bound organelles. Also, membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum separate areas of the cytoplasm and allow them to function independently.",

Without any direct observational evidence to assist them (the very first electron microscopes were only just being built and they could not reveal membrane structure) Davson and Danielli suggested a kind of \u2018sandwich\u2019 of protein and phospholipid. This was based on what they knew of the proportions of the two substances in the membrane. The protein was to form the \u2018bread\u2019 of the sandwich with the phospholipid forming the \u2018filling\u2019. In 1954 they proposed a revised model in which they included protein-lined pores. Figure 4.20 shows the Davson\u2013Danielli models of 1935 and 1954. As more and more evidence accumulated about how molecules moved across membranes, it became clear that the Davson\u2013Danielli model could not adequately explain all the new evidence. The idea model therefore had to be rejected. In 1972, Singer and Nicholson proposed a totally different arrangement of the phospholipids and proteins in the plasma membrane. They retained the idea of a phospholipid bilayer, but rejected the sandwich arrangement. Instead, they suggested that proteins were \u2018studded\u2019 into the bilayer at different points. They also suggested that the arrangement was not static, but was fluid and constantly changing. Figure 4.21 shows the difference between the Davson\u2013Danielli model and the original fluid mosaic model. As our understanding of processes that occur at the plasma membrane has increased and we have learned more of cell structure and function, the fluid mosaic model has become more sophisticated. Our current idea of membrane structure still assumes this fluid-mosaic nature, but there is now much more detail to the model, as figure 4.22 shows. The key features of the model as we currently understand it are: \u2022 The phospholipid bilayer as the basis for the membrane \u2022 Integral proteins (also known as intrinsic proteins and trans-membrane proteins) that span the membrane. Some of these proteins play an important role in moving substances across the membrane. There are three main types of these transport proteins: \u2013 channel proteins \u2013 these proteins have a channel through them along which a specific ion can pass; there are different channel proteins for different ions \u2013 carrier proteins \u2013 these proteins act in a more sophisticated way to move larger molecules through the membrane by facilitated diffusion or active transport; the ones involved in active transport are often referred to as pumps \u2013 peripheral proteins (also known as extrinsic proteins) that span only one layer (or sometimes less) of the membrane. They have a range of functions; some are enzymes, others anchor integral proteins to the cytoskeleton \u2022 Glycoproteins and glycolipids \u2013 protein and lipid molecules that have carbohydrate chains attached to them and often serve as signals to other cells. They also act as receptor sites for hormones and drugs.

If particles are, for some reason, concentrated in a small area, they will move in such a way that the particles \u2018spread out\u2019 and occupy all the space that is available to them. This is a result of random particular motion. Diffusion need not involve a membrane. When particles diffuse across a plasma membrane, there must be a concentration difference between the two sides of the membrane (a concentration gradient) to drive the process. As diffusion proceeds, the high concentration will decrease and the low concentration will increase until the two concentrations are the same. At this point there will be no further net diffusion. This means that although particles will still move across the membrane, they will move equally in both directions, so there will be no overall effect. We say that the concentrations are in equilibrium. Figures 4.24 and 4.25 show this. The rate at which diffusion across a membrane takes place is influenced by: \u2022 the concentration gradient \u2013 a bigger difference in concentration results in faster diffusion than a smaller gradient \u2022 the thickness of the membrane \u2013 as all plasma membranes are the same thickness, this is not really an issue when considering diffusion into and out of cells, but for other situations where particles must cross some kind of barrier, a shorter distance results in faster diffusion \u2022 the surface area of the membrane \u2013 clearly if there is more membrane where diffusion can take place, diffusion will happen faster These features are all related in an equation called Fick\u2019s law of diffusion: Rate of diffusion \u221d Surface area of membrane \u00d7 Concentration difference Diffusion distance The rate of diffusion is also influenced by temperature.

Note in both cases that the particles are moving from a high concentration to a low concentration (as with simple diffusion). However, also note that whilst the ions can simply move straight through the ion pore of a channel protein, the carrier protein must undergo a conformational change (change in shape) to move particles through the membrane.

        "chunk_text": "The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the\nstroma of the chloroplasts. They comprise a complex cycle of\nreactions that involves the addition of carbon dioxide to a pre-\nexisting five-carbon molecule (a molecule containing five carbon\natoms) within the chloroplast. The resulting molecules are modified\nto regenerate the original molecule whilst, at the same time,\nsynthesising glucose. The sequence of reactions was discovered by\nMelvin Calvin, an American biologist. Because of his work, the\nlight-independent reactions are also referred to as the Calvin cycle.\nIn the 1950s Melvin Calvin experimented with unicellular algae\ncalled Chlorella by exposing them to radioactive carbon dioxide.\nAfter different periods of time, the algae were killed and the\nchemicals in the algae that contained radioactive carbon (which\nmust have come from the carbon dioxide) were identified using\ntwo-dimensional chromatography.\n\nAs time passes more compounds contain the radioactive carbon.\nBy refining the experiment and using shorter and shorter intervals,\nCalvin identified the first stable compound to be formed as\na compound containing three carbon atoms called glycerate\nphosphate (GP).\n\nThe main stages of the light-independent reactions are:\n\u2022 carbon dioxide reacts with ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) \u2013 a\nfive-carbon compound in the stroma; the reaction is catalysed by\nthe enzyme Rubisco.\n\u2022 two molecules of the three-carbon compound GP are formed\nfrom this reaction as shows\n\u2022 each molecule of GP is converted to TP (triose phosphate \u2013\nanother three-carbon compound); this is a reduction reaction\nusing hydrogen ions from reduced NADP and energy from ATP\n\u2022 some of the TP formed is used to regenerate the RuBP (ATP is\nagain required) whilst some is used to form glucose and other\nuseful organic compounds\n\nsummarises the light-independent reactions of\nphotosynthesis. It shows how three \u2018turns of the cycle\u2019 result in an\noutput of one molecule of TP. Six turns of the cycle would give an\noutput of two molecules of TP \u2013 enough to make one molecule of\nglucose.",

When\nC3 plants do this, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the leaves\nfalls and the enzyme Rubisco starts to behave in an unusual way.\nIn the low concentrations of carbon dioxide, Rubisco binds with\noxygen, not carbon dioxide.

The cells of the bundle sheath contain\nchloroplasts, which they don\u2019t in C3 plants.
